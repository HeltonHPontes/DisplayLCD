Implementing PIC (Microcontroller) LCD Display using printf function with XC8 compiler

This code was created for PIC18F... microcontroller family. 
To use with other Microcontroller family a small modifications are required

To use the printf function to write on the LCD Display, it's necessary to create the "putch" function.
Where the "putch" function will be responsible for making the interface between the printf function and the LCD Display.
